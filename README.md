# word-stacker
A word-cloud-like utility that shows word frequency in text/code/etc.  It works fine, but needs a lot of cleanup work, so hopefully this repo will get me working on it again.

In this screenshot we can see the complete works of William Shakespeare split into two color ranges.  From white/yellow/brown are the most common 10,000 words in English.  From light to dark blue are all the rest.  Right away we can see “thou” and “thy” are very commonly occurring (in the third row) but stand out in darker brown because they are very uncommon in typical English.  The first blue words are also revealing: “o”, “hath”, “’tis”.  All of this demonstrates how easily this app can pick out the words that reveal the style of writing, and it works just as well on code.

This screenshot is more for fun.  It shows the frequency of words that do NOT appear in the 10,000 most common English words list.  For example, the word “bolingbroke” appears 173 times, but I have no idea what it means!
